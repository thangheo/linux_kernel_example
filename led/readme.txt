This is an example of a Linux kernel module that implements a GPIO driver for controlling an LED connected to a specific pin (pin 17).
 The driver can turn the LED on and off and read its status.

Compilation and Installation
To compile the driver, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile and run the make command:

make
This will compile the led_driver.c file and generate the kernel module led_driver.ko.

To install the driver, run the following command with root privileges:

insmod led_driver.ko
This will load the module into the kernel.

Usage
Once the driver is installed, the LED can be controlled using the test_led application provided.
 To compile the application, navigate to the test directory and run the make command:
4. Compile the test.c file by running the following command in the terminal:

gcc test_led.c -o test_led
This will compile the test_led.c file and generate the test_led executable.

To turn the LED on, run the following command:

./test_led on
To turn the LED off, run the following command:

./test_led off
To read the status of the LED, run the following command:

./test_led read

Removal
To remove the driver from the kernel, run the following command with root privileges:

bash
Copy code
rmmod led_driver
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the driver, check the kernel logs using the dmesg command. This may provide useful information on the cause of the issue

1. Compile the kernel module by running the following command in the terminal:

$make

This command will compile the kernel module and generate a timer_interrupt.ko file in your current directory.

2. Load the kernel module by running the following command in the terminal:

sudo insmod timer_interrupt.ko
3. Verify that the kernel module loaded correctly by checking the system log:

dmesg | tail

This command will show the last few lines of the system log, which should include a message indicating that the timer interrupt handler was registered.

4. Compile the test.c file by running the following command in the terminal:

gcc test.c -o test

5.Run the test program by running the following command in the terminal:

./test

#######################################
In the example kernel module we created, the timer interrupt handler function is registered to handle the timer interrupt, which is triggered periodically by the hardware timer in the system.

When the usleep function is called in a user-space program, it causes the program to pause execution for a certain amount of time, specified in microseconds. The usleep function is implemented in the C library, which uses system calls to interact with the kernel.

In our example, when the usleep function is called, it causes the user-space program to pause execution for the specified amount of time. During this time, the kernel continues to run and handle interrupts, including the timer interrupt. When the timer interrupt occurs, the interrupt handler function registered by our kernel module is invoked by the kernel.

The interrupt handler function prints a message to the system log using the printk function, which is a kernel-level logging function. The message is then displayed in the system log when the dmesg command is run in the terminal.

So, when the usleep function is called, it pauses the user-space program for a certain amount of time while the kernel continues to run and handle interrupts. When the timer interrupt occurs, the interrupt handler function registered by our kernel module is invoked and prints a message to the system log.
